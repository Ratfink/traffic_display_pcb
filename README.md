Around half of the schematic is heavily based on the [Adafruit Feather ESP8266
HUZZAH](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Feather-ESP8266-HUZZAH-PCB).
Although Adafruit seems to have forgotten to include the exact version of the
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license used (at the time of writing),
and this project is not really a redistribution of theirs, I will include their
